     Explanation:
     ============
     node1 and node2 are names of (abstract)classes or interfaces

     possible values of type are:
       -  ASSOCIATION             bidirectional association
       -  ASSOCIATION_DIRECTED    unidirectional association  from node1 to node 2
       -  AGGREGATE               node2 is the aggregate
       -  COMPOSITE               node2 is the composite
       -  INHERITANCE             node2 is the superclass or (super)interface
                                  node1 is a subclass or subinterface which may
				  have relations to other classes/interfaces
				  
       -  INHERITANCE_MULTI       node2 is the superclass or (super)interface
                                  node1 is the subclass.
				  node2 may have more subclasses than the template defines,
				  but none of them may have relations to other classes/interfaces.
       -  DEPENDENCY		  node1 depends on node2
