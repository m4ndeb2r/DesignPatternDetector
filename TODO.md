# TODO's

## TODO's in the code
* Get rid of TODO's in the code (JavaDoc, improvements, etc.)
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML
* Cleanup code (dead code, comments)
* What to do with matching relations in Solution (show it in feedback? remove it?)

## TODO: testing
* More extensive testing in integration tests (solutions/feedback)
* Remove code smells form integration tests. 
* Get rid of @Ignore annotations (ChainOfResponsibilityMatchingTest for example)

## Other (final) project deliverables
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable
  * Use note tags for general warnings

## Won't do's:
* JavaFX unit testing. Looks like we need another framework to do this properly...
