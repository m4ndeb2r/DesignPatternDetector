# TODO's

## TODO's in the code
* Get rid of TODO's in the code (JavaDoc, improvements, etc.)

## TODO: testing
* More extensive testing in integration tests (solutions/feedback); remove code smells from integration tests; Get rid of @Ignore annotations (ChainOfResponsibilityMatchingTest for example)

## Other (final) project deliverables
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable
  * use this overall patterns file in the integration tests

## Won't do's:
* JavaFX unit testing. Looks like we need another framework to do this properly...
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML. We did this for many cases. Nice to have, but since we have a stable GUI, let's skip this.
