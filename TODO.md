# TODO's

## TODO's in the code
* Get rid of TODO's in the code (JavaDoc, improvements, etc.)

## TODO: testing
* Solve the mystery in MediatorMatchingTest: non-matching systems with no node/relation analysed?!?!
  Or is this a BUG in our feedback?

## Other (final) project deliverables
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable

## Won't do's:
* JavaFX unit testing. Looks like we need another framework to do this properly...
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML. We did this for many cases. Nice to have, but since we have a stable GUI, let's skip this.
