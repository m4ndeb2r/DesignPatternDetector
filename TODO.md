# TODO's

## TODO's in the code
* Get rid of TODO's in the code (JavaDoc, improvements, etc.)
* Test-coverage GUI (JavaFX testing is not that straight-forward ... sadly)
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML
* Cleanup test files
* Cleanup code (dead code, comments)
* JavaDoc (some of it is old, missing, or superfluous....)
* What to do with matching relations in Solution (show it in feedback? remove it?)
* Implement or remove unimplemented menu items in GUI.
* Refine matching process (including parsing enhancements)

## TODO: testing
* separate integration tests from unittests
* Consider more tests for the GUI....
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable

## TODO's in documentation 
* Document Observer pattern of JavaFX

## TODO Logging
* Check the log files. Is there too much, enough, not enough relevant logging?
