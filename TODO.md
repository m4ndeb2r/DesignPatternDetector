# TODO's

## Final project deliverables
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable

## Won't do's:
* JavaFX unit testing. Looks like we need another framework to do this properly...
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML. We did this for many cases. Nice to have, but since we have a stable GUI, let's skip this.
