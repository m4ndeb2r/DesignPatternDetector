# TODO's

## TODO's in the code
* Get rid of TODO's in the code (JavaDoc, improvements, etc.)
* Styling in CSS instead of FXML
* Cleanup code (dead code, comments)
* JavaDoc (some of it is old, missing, or superfluous....)
* What to do with matching relations in Solution (show it in feedback? remove it?)
* Implement or remove unimplemented menu items in GUI.

## TODO: testing
* Get better coverage with unittests (integration tests are separate, and should not be included in coverage metrics)
* Test-coverage GUI (JavaFX testing is not that straight-forward ... sadly)
* Finish unit tests for ArgoUML parsers (coverage is now 81% - 86%)
* More extensive testing in integration tests (solutions/feedback)
* Get rid of @Ignore annotations (ChainOfResponsibilityMatchingTest for example)

## Other (final) project deliverables
* Create an overall patterns file with all GOF patterns as a deliverable
  * Use note tags for general warnings
